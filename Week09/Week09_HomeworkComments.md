# Mobile App Development Week 09 Homework Notes

## Progress
- Followed the FireCards firebase tutorial, linking the app to my own firebase project

## Resources
- Kodeco FireCards firebase tutorial
- Class version of the FireCards app with the up-to-date SDK

## Reflection
This week, I recreated the FireCards firebase tutorial app and linked it to a new firebase project. Following this tutorial was a little hard, and I had a little trouble where my version of the app was not syncing up with the firebase project, which I later realized was because it was still connecting back to the original firebase project. After this obstacle, which took a while to figure out, the rest of the tutorial was not too hard to follow. However, I still don't understand how the app switches between users and will probably need to find some more tutorials to fully understand how to implement firebase in an app of my own design, which I plan on incorporating into my final project.
