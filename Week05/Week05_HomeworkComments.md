Mobile App Development Week 05 Homework Notes

Building off of AppStorage Demo

Reflection:
I spent about 9 hours on this project. My main goals with this projects were to build off the AppStorage demo, use the CRUD outline the app features, and work with stylizing the text and user interface. I was able to build off the AppStorage demo and work with customizing the UI, but didn't have enough time to fully implement every part of CRUD, which I will work on in the coming weeks. I had the most difficulty finding a way to store and update the pantry items (I also haven't figured out a way to visualize them on the shelves yet). Figuring out how to stylize the UI also took quite a bit of time, but was much simpler than figuring out the item storage. There are a couple of other buttons, like a Shopping List button, that I had initially planned to add to the app but did not have the time to implement. I think this project was fun, but took a lot more time than I had anticipated. 

Difficulties:
- Changing the background color of the entire app (ended up doing this by setting the background color on each page)
- Implementing the "Add" feature (it currently works, but isn't very efficient and will probably need to be changed when the "Use" feature is properly implemented) 

Continuing Issues with this app:
- Having difficulty figuring out an efficient way to store and update the pantry items, this issue becomes very prominent in trying to figure out how to "use" an item (delete it or decrease the amount of it)
    - Currently, the onle way to edit items already in the list is to completely clear the pantry
- Have not yet figured out how to actually visualize the items on the shelves in the UI

Improvements:
- Clean up code
- Complete the unfinished features ("Use" button and pantry item visualization)
- Add in the other features I wanted to add ("Running low" list and "Shopping list")
