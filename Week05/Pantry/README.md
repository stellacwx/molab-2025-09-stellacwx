#  Pantry App

## General
Utilizes AppStorage to create a virtual pantry
* Currently can only add items and view the items in a list, for deleting items can only clear entire pantry
* Items are not yet visualized on the shelves

## Resources
Building off the AppStorage demo
Uses Navigation buttons to navigate between different pages

## Reflection
I spent about 8 hours on this project. My main goals with this projects were to build off the AppStorage demo, use the CRUD outline the app features, and work with stylizing the text and user interface. I was able to build off the AppStorage demo and work with customizing the UI, but didn't have enough time to fully implement every part of CRUD, which I will work on in the coming weeks. I had the most difficulty finding a way to store and update the pantry items (I also haven't figured out a way to visualize them on the shelves yet). Figuring out how to stylize the UI also took quite a bit of time, but was much simpler than figuring out the item storage. There are a couple of other buttons, like a Shopping List button, that I had initially planned to add to the app but did not have the time to implement. I think this project was fun, but took a lot more time than I had anticipated.
