Mobile App Development Week 06 Homework Notes

General:
Utilizes AppStorage to create a virtual pantry
- Converted from AppStorage to JSON for storing pantry item data, can now use items in addition to clearing the entire pantry at once
- Items are not yet visualized on the shelves

Resources:
Building off the AppStorage demo and the ImageEditDemoJSON
Learning sources: Hacking with SwiftUI, Developer Documentation, Swift by Sundell

Reflection:
This week I built off of the project I was working on last week, which was creating a virtual pantry. The main switch was that I was able to use JSON instead of AppStorage for storing the data of my pantry items using the Image Edit JSON demo shown in class, which is now much easier to use and allowed me to code using a specific item in the pantry without any issue. I have not been able to visualize the shelves of the pantry yet, but I think that will be much easier now that all the item data is stored using JSON rather than AppStorage. I have now been able to implement all four parts of CRUD, which was one of my original goals.

Continuing issues with this app:
- Have not yet figured out how to actually visualize the items on the shelves in the UI, but I think it will be much easier now with JSON

Improvements:
- Clean up code
- Complete the unfinished features (pantry item visualization)
- Add in the other features I wanted to add ("Running low" list and "Shopping list")
