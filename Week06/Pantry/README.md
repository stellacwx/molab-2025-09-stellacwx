#  Pantry App
Go to ContentView for the main view (works better in the simulator)

## General
* Utilizing AppStorage to create a virtual pantry
* Converted from AppStorage to JSON for storing pantry item data, can now use items in addition to clearing the entire pantry at once
* Items are still not yet visualized on the shelves

## Reflection
This week I built off of the project I was working on last week, which was creating a virtual pantry. The main switch was that I was able to use JSON instead of AppStorage for storing the data of my pantry items using the Image Edit JSON demo shown in class, which is now much easier to use and allowed me to code using a specific item in the pantry without any issue. I have not been able to visualize the shelves of the pantry yet, but I think that will be much easier now that all the item data is stored using JSON rather than AppStorage.
