## General
Create and scroll through journal entries
Add a photo, title, date, emotion, and notes
Built based off the PhotoPickBlender demo utilising its PhotoPicker file

## Reflection
I created this journaling app as an extension of the PhotoPicker in the PhotoPickBlender demo shown in class. I also used the JSON storing methods that I had learned last week from the JSON UI Image demo. I think creating this project was much smoother flowing than last week's, and I overall didn't have any huge problems. The most challenging part of this project I would say was actually implementing the JSON storage, which I was having difficulty with last week, but it was much easier this time now that I had experience. The PhotoPicker wasn't too hard to implement because mine had pretty much the same functionality as the one in PhotoPickBlender, and thus it didn't really need any modification. I really enjoyed this project and look forward to improving on it in the future.

## Persisting Issues
I don't think there are any issues with the code I currently have.

## Future Improvements
- Make entries editable after creating them
- Improve UI
- Make customizable color palette for the UI
- Allow for user to choose between different UI layouts
