#  Recipe Book App

## General
 - play button plays music
 - timer button sets a timer for 10 seconds, and when time's up creates a sound and stops the music if it's playing
 - two recipes, chicken noodle soup and tomato soup to look at
 
 ## Reflection
 I based my code off of the ImageUiDemo and SlideShowDemo projects shown in class and learned from Hacking with SwiftUI and the Apple Developer Documentation (Quick Help feature and Google searches). If I had more time, I would make the timer adjustable through user input and also clean up the code to make it more efficient. I had the most difficulty with getting the audio to play. I would also want to explore making the UI look better. One issue I encountered was line spacing in multi-line text in that the space between lines was too large, so I created separate text entries for each line, but it felt like there should be a better way to accomplish that.
