#  Camera App
Must run on device to work

## General
- Adapted from the CaptureRecorder app shown in class
- Played around with different filter options, landed on a couple that I liked

## Resources
Mainly the class demo, I also used the Apple Developer Documentation to help understand the different filter options and used AI to debug and get the camera working for the project.

## Reflection
I took a long time at the beginning just reading the code and trying to understand it, then I mainly played around with the different filter options available in the Core Image Filter Reference. Most of the code is copied from the CaptureRecorderApp shown in class, and I modified the filter options, creating filters using what I read in the Core Image Filter Reference. It was a little confusing at first how to change the settings for the filter and how to get the camera to work, which I ended up using AI to help me debug on. Overall, I think this would be an interesting project to continue and create more custom filters.
