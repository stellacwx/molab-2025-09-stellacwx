# Development Notes

## Week 01

### Progress

### Next Week's Steps
- Add second UI view
- Add map view (can push this back a week later too)

## Week 02

### Progress
- Started creating new UI layout for the journal view

### Difficulties
- Having a difficult time figuring out how to implement the page-turning mechanism, will need to do more research and try different options
- Was trying TabView, not sure if that will work

### Next Week's Steps
- Finish journal UI layout
- Add color palettes
- Add map function
